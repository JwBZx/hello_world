# hello_world
Welcome to My JWB Hello World Repository! I am making this repository to go along with the GitHub "Hello World" Guide.

Hello! My name is Jonathan, though you can call me Jonathan, and I am currently a Senior High School student who is learning JavaScript and Mobile Application Development with Meteor!
The amazing Web Team at NewSpring Church is teaching me all of that, and they do an excellent job at everything! :)

Well, I think that's it for this README file! Thank You and God Bless!
